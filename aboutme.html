       Hi and welcome to my page my name is Alex Sarmiento.

        I study to be an Economy assistent and I realize that
        I did not burn for that career after few years. Also I worked as a Postman
        that was kind of cool but after all I found something
        that I did burn for and that is the programation. <BR></BR>

       I am a front end developer student currently studying
       in Jensen Yrkehögskola. I will finish studies by 2022 but if you need any help in
       any project or coolaboration just <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me and we will talk about it. 
      </p>
